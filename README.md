## 📖 Introduction

**Skillbox Studio** is a modern desktop application designed to unify the management of extended skills (Skills / MCP Tools) for various AI Agents.

In today's AI-assisted programming landscape, we often switch between different Agents like **Claude**, **Cursor**, and **Windsurf**. Skillbox Studio is dedicated to solving the problem of skill fragmentation, allowing you to easily discover, install, synchronize, and manage all powerful AI skill packages through a beautiful visual interface.

## ✨ Features

- **🌐 Unified Marketplace**
  Built-in curated skill library (Business, Coding, Writing, Automation, etc.), providing an App Store-like browsing and installation experience.
  
- **🤖 Multi-Agent Support**
  Download once, run everywhere. Supports one-click installation of skills to over ten mainstream AI assistants including Claude, Cursor, and Trae.
  
- **📂 Local Skills Management**
  Scans and recognizes your existing local skill directories, easily registering them to different Agents without manual copy-pasting of configuration files.

- **🎨 Premium Modern UI**
  Adopts the latest Fluent/Glassmorphism design language, perfectly fits Dark Mode, and provides smooth interaction animations.

- **🔗 Custom Repositories**
  Supports adding third-party GitHub repositories as skill sources, flexibly expanding the boundaries of your skill library.
